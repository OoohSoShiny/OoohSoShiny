- 👋 Hi, I’m @OoohSoShiny
- 🌱 Just finishing my training as software dev with a focus on C# and java. Another focus was SQL and mySQL - mostly via the .NET Framework. I have worked on projects using C++ and Python, even though not on a large scale. I have worked on GUIS using HTML, XML and XAML. The three IDEs I have used the most was Visual Studio 18/22, Android Studio and PyCharm. I have worked on a small scale Project using C++ and a microcontroller to check noise levels in a room. My final exams project was an Android-App using Retrofit to access my Web-API to access my SQL database on a MSSQL Server - this app was created to help small scale dairy farmers accessing their animal-data on the go. In my free time I am working in UE5 right now, just doing some entry level tutorials. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting to be honest.
- 📫 How to reach me: Ghosttalker2@web.de is a good start
